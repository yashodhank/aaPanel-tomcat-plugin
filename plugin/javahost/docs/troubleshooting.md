# Troubleshooting

All issues below are grounded in JavaHost's actual behaviour. Operations return
the panel's standard `{status, msg}` envelope; on failure `msg` carries the
error string. Most failures are intentionally **fail-closed** — JavaHost refuses
to proceed rather than do something unsafe.

## Download or verification failures

JavaHost verifies every Tomcat/JDK artifact before using it, and never silently
skips verification (`core/util/download.py`).

- **`no SHA-512 provided for <name>; refusing to use unverified artifact`**
  No hash was available (neither explicit nor a downloadable `.sha512`). For an
  offline install you must pass `--sha512`. See INSTALL.md (offline section).
- **`SHA-512 mismatch for <name>`**
  The downloaded (or local) file does not match the expected hash. Re-download,
  or confirm the `--sha512` you passed matches the tarball. A mismatch is always
  treated as an error.
- **`gpg not installed; cannot verify OpenPGP signature`**
  Signature verification was requested but `gpg` is missing. Install `gpg`, or
  proceed with SHA-512 only — when no keyring can be built the installer skips
  the signature step but still enforces SHA-512 (`installer._keyring` returns
  `None` if gpg/keys are unavailable).
- **OpenPGP `--verify` failed**
  The detached signature did not validate against the Apache KEYS keyring. Do not
  bypass this; re-fetch the artifact from an official mirror.
- **Downloads hang/time out**
  `curl` is used with retries and `--max-time`; if curl is absent, a `urllib`
  fallback is used. Check outbound HTTPS to Apache/Adoptium, or use the offline
  `--local` path.

## Java version floor not met

Each Tomcat line has a minimum Java major that is enforced before any files are
written (`installer.ensure_java`):

- Tomcat 10.1 requires **Java 11+**.
- Tomcat 11 requires **Java 17+**.

If no installed JDK satisfies the floor, JavaHost auto-installs a verified
Temurin JDK (17, or 21 when the floor is above 17). To pin which detected JDK is
used, pass `--prefer-java N` (still subject to the floor). Supported Java majors
are 8 / 11 / 17 / 21; anything else is rejected by input validation.

## systemd vs init.d

JavaHost prefers systemd and falls back to init.d automatically
(`core/tomcat/service.py`). systemd is used only when **both** `systemctl` is on
PATH **and** `/run/systemd/system` exists.

- With systemd: units are `javahost-<app>.service`; lifecycle uses
  `systemctl enable --now / start / stop / restart`, status via `is-active`.
- Without systemd: a lint-clean script is written to `/etc/init.d/javahost-<app>`
  and driven with `start|stop|restart|status`.

Both paths consume the same `bin/setenv.sh` as the single source of truth.
`JAVA_HOME` is supplied via the environment, never parsed from a shebang.

If a service status reads `unknown` (systemd) or `absent`/`inactive` (init.d),
inspect the per-app logs (below), then try **RepairApp**.

## Port already in use

App ports are validated to the 1–65535 range, but JavaHost does not pre-check
whether a port is free. If Tomcat fails to bind, the per-app `catalina` log will
show a bind/`Address already in use` error. Pick a free port when creating the
app (`CreateApp` accepts `port`, default 8080), or stop the conflicting service.
The instance's listening port is read back from `conf/server.xml`
(`GetAppDetail`).

## javax → jakarta WAR warning

Tomcat 10/11 use the `jakarta.*` namespace; Tomcat 9 uses `javax.*`. On deploy,
JavaHost inspects the WAR and returns a non-fatal `warning` (`DeployWar` →
`war.namespace_warning`) when there is a mismatch:

- A `javax`/mixed WAR on Tomcat 10/11: it will not run as-is — use the Apache
  Tomcat Migration Tool for Jakarta EE, or deploy on Tomcat 9.
- A `jakarta` WAR on Tomcat 9: it requires Tomcat 10+.

The WAR is still extracted (extraction is zip-slip-safe); the warning surfaces in
the response so the UI can show it.

## App unreachable on its public port (loopback by design)

Every Tomcat and JAR connector binds to **`127.0.0.1:<port>`** on purpose — the
raw app port is **not** exposed on the box's public interface. `http://<public-ip>:<port>/`
will refuse/time out; that is expected, not a bug. Reach the app **through a
reverse-proxy domain** (`SetSite`, then the HTTPS toggle / `SetSiteSSL`). On the
box, verify with `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`. The **Open ↗** link in the UI
targets the proxy domain; with none configured it offers **Set up reverse proxy**
instead of a dead link.

## "runtime missing" badge / app won't restart

A red **runtime missing** badge means the app's pinned `JAVA_HOME` no longer
exists (its JDK was uninstalled — typically a `Force` uninstall). The app may
still be serving on its live JVM but **will not survive a restart** (`list_apps()`
reports `runtime_ok: false`). Reinstall that Java major (Runtimes → Install /
Reinstall) or repoint the app to a present JDK, then restart. Force-uninstalling a
JDK now also stops its dependents so they fail cleanly rather than lingering as
zombie JVMs that falsely report healthy.

## Drawer shows "runtime missing"

The app's pinned `JAVA_HOME` no longer exists — a JDK the app uses was
uninstalled (typically a `Force` uninstall). The app is **alive but will die on
restart**. Reinstall that Java major (**Runtimes → Install / Reinstall**) or
repoint the app to a present JDK, then restart. This is the `runtime_ok: false`
state described above.

## Site & SSL says "HTTP only / not enabled"

This is **expected**, not an error: the site simply has no HTTPS configured. The
drawer shows a neutral **"HTTP only" / "not enabled"** rather than a red alarm.
To provision a certificate, enable the **per-site HTTPS toggle** (row / drawer
Overview, `SetSiteSSL`). Red errors (no redirect, HTTPS unreachable, cert
expired) appear only once HTTPS is actually on.

## "aaPanel site registration failed" on SetSite

**Root cause:** JavaHost registers reverse-proxy sites through aaPanel's internal
site management API. If that API is unreachable, site creation fails with this
error. Prior to v0.28.0, the plugin silently fell back to writing a standalone
nginx vhost that worked at the nginx level but never appeared in aaPanel's Sites
panel — sites were invisible and unmanageable from aaPanel UI.

**Current behaviour (v0.28.0+):** Site registration goes through aaPanel's native
API exclusively (3-tier fallback: class API → legacy panelSite → HTTP API). If
all paths fail, the error is returned with diagnostics showing which paths were
tried.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Error mentions `http-api-skipped-no-key` | `aapanel_api_key` not configured | Set `aapanel_api_key` in plugin config (Settings → API Key) |
| Error mentions `class-api, legacy-panelsite, http-api` (all tried, none worked) | aaPanel panel service is down or site module is broken | Restart aaPanel (`bt restart`), check `/www/server/panel/class/site.py` exists |
| Error mentions `class-api, legacy-panelsite` only (no http-api in list) | `aapanel_api_key` unset AND class/legacy APIs failed | Set `aapanel_api_key` in plugin config, then retry |

The `aapanel_api_key` is the aaPanel interface API key (`api_sk`). Find it in
aaPanel → Settings → API Interface. Copy it into JavaHost → Settings → API Key.

## "Installed locally: no" for MongoDB (or any engine)

The Databases support matrix' **Installed locally** column detects a DB
**server/client binary on the host** (`detect_local` → e.g. `psql`, `mysql`,
`mariadb`, `mongod`). A database that runs only in **Docker** or on a **remote**
host shows **no** — yet apps still connect to it fine over TCP. It is a
host-binary probe, **not** a connectivity check, so "no" is not a problem as long
as your `SetDbEnv` host/port are reachable.

## A long install looks like it "failed" (it didn't)

JDK/Tomcat install/reinstall/uninstall and the app lifecycle run as **async
background jobs** (`StartInstallJava` / `StartInstallTomcat` / `StartReinstallJava`
/ `StartUninstallJava` / `StartUninstallTomcat` / `StartAppAction`), each returning
a `{job_id}` immediately. A slow Adoptium/Apache download therefore no longer
times out the panel request. Only treat an operation as failed when its **Task**
shows `failed` (Tasks tab → `GetJobs` / `GetJobLog`) — not because the click took
a while.

## SSL / certificate issuance failures

`SetSiteSSL{app, enable}` issues a Let's Encrypt cert and flips the vhost to HTTPS.
It tries **aaPanel-native ACME first** and falls back to **certbot `--webroot`**
when native doesn't place a live cert (aaPanel's bundled LE is broken against
pyOpenSSL ≥24 on some hosts); certbot errors (rate-limit / DNS / challenge) are
surfaced, not swallowed. A cert is **never** issued against a guessed FQDN — a
real domain must exist (stored site domain, explicit `domain`, or the
`site_suffix` convention). Disabling SSL reverts to HTTP but **keeps the cert on
disk**, so re-enabling is instant. The drawer's **Site & SSL** block
(`GetSiteStatus`) reports cert validity/expiry and live reachability.

## Where logs live

- **Per-app logs:** `/www/server/javahost/instances/<app>/logs/`. JavaHost reads
  `catalina.out` first, then any `catalina*.log` (`instance.tail_log`).
- **GetLogs endpoint:** returns a memory-safe tail of that log. `lines` defaults
  to 200 and is clamped to 2000.
- **Panel action log:** lifecycle actions are recorded via the panel's
  `WriteLog` under the `JavaHost` tag. Secrets are never logged — `SetDbEnv`
  reports `env: written (secrets not echoed)`.

## Repairing a broken app (RepairApp)

Use **RepairApp** after an OS upgrade or when a unit is stale/half-broken
(`instance.repair`). It:

1. Reads `JAVA_HOME` / `CATALINA_HOME` back from the app's `bin/setenv.sh`
   (errors if either is missing).
2. Removes a stale `temp/tomcat.pid`.
3. Re-renders and reinstalls the service unit.
4. Restarts it if active, otherwise enables + starts it.

If `setenv.sh` is missing the required values, repair fails with a clear message
— recreate the app in that case.

## "Refusing to remove …" on uninstall/delete

Removal helpers (`fs.safe_rmtree`) refuse to delete a directory that lacks the
`.javahost-managed` marker or sits outside the managed roots
(`/www/server/javahost`, and JavaHost's own units under `/etc/systemd/system` /
`/etc/init.d`). This is a guardrail, not a bug: only JavaHost-created paths are
removable.

For a controlled teardown, use **Settings → Danger zone**: preview
(`WipePreview`) then `Wipe` with a typed `WIPE` confirm and a scope from
`{apps, jdks, tomcats, sites, full}`. A wipe **skips runtimes still in use** by an
app and never touches other plugins' configs or any database. Plugin uninstall
(`install.sh uninstall`) keeps data by **default**, unless the Danger zone wrote a
`/www/server/javahost/.uninstall_plan` selecting a wider scope.
