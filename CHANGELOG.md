## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-06

First release of **JavaHost**, an independent clean-room rewrite. This project
replaces an earlier prototype that was a fork of aaPanel's proprietary `tomcat2`
plugin; that code has been removed and the git history reset so no aaPanel
source is present in any commit (see `docs/audit/`).

### Added
- Clean-room plugin `javahost` (Apache-2.0), built only against the panel's
  public plugin API — contains no aaPanel source, UI, or assets.
- Tomcat version registry with dynamic latest-patch resolution for 9 / 10.1 / 11.
- **Integrity-verified** Tomcat & JDK downloads (SHA-512 + OpenPGP, fail-closed),
  with offline (local tarball + hash) support.
- Java runtime layer: detect 8/11/17/21, install Temurin 17/21, robust
  `java -version` parsing, JVM-flag validation for Java 17/21.
- **systemd** service generation (init.d fallback); `JAVA_HOME` supplied via
  environment, never parsed from a script line.
- Security hardening on install: remove examples/docs/manager webapps, no AJP,
  shutdown port disabled, runs as `www`, locked-down config permissions.
- Zip-slip-safe WAR deployment; `javax`→`jakarta` namespace detection/warnings.
- Plugin-owned Nginx reverse-proxy vhost generator.
- PostgreSQL 17 JDBC guidance + secret-safe `app.env` pattern.
- Idempotent install with atomic staging + rollback, disk precheck, and
  managed-marker uninstall.
- Offline unit test suite (pytest) and CI (lint + tests + signed-zip artifact).
